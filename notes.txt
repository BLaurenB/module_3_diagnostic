workflow - are checking that we're TDDing


commit every 15 min - they want to see our process
(or more when you finish part of a user story)


start with a feature test.
get the test to pass with simplest solutions (and note completion in commits)
  - write the code in the view that you want to use
  - get to work in controller, then refactor
